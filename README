Toolbox to do a SEM-like analysis (path analysis) based on CP-Logic.

This tool depends on:
* Python (tested on 2.6.2, others might work)
* Bernd Gutmann's CP-Logic to Problog compiler
* Problog with YAP (see http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/)
* Gnuplot
* R

Edit semcplogic/config.py to point to the correct install locations for these programs.
